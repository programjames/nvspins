Our VNA data acquisition and T1 fitting code can be found at the bottom of `T3E3.ipynb`. We saved a copy of the data in `angs.txt`.
Our oscilloscope data acquisition can be found on the lab computer, but we saved a copy of the data in `amps.npy`. The fitting code can be found in `T1 Fitting.ipynb`.
